# Zombie Apocalypse Rimworld Mod
A previously unknown disease that causes the host to show unseen aggression and survivability is spreading across the rim. Can you survive facing this new threat?

This mod tries to be vanilla-ish. So (hopefully) no unintuitive new behaviours, no fancy zombie mutations. Just walking dead people. All the zombies behave just like other pawns in the game and are clickable etc.

## Zombies

For every living thing in your modded game a unique zombie-version is generated. When a living thing dies due to zombies, it will reanimate as a zombie that matches it's original appearance and stats.
